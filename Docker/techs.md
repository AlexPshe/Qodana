# Qodana. Docker Image Paths and Configuration Options

### Docker image paths
- **/data/project**       -- root directory of the project to be analyzed
- **/data/results**       -- directory to store the analysis results, needs to be empty before the Qodana run
- **/root/.config/idea**  -- idea configuration directory
- **/opt/idea**           -- directory of the idea distributive
- **/data/profile.xml**   -- used if a profile wasn't configured by run options or via `qodana.yaml`. See [Order of resolving profile](#Order-of-resolving-profile).

### Configuring
Available arguments:
```
$ docker run jetbrains/qodana
Usage:
  entrypoint [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -i, --project-dir= Project folder to inspect  (default: current work dir
                     /data/project)
  -o, --results-dir= Save results to folder (default: /data/results)
  -r, --report-dir=  Save html report to folder (default: /data/results/report)
  -s, --save-report  Generate html report
  -w, --show-report  Serve html report on port 8080

Help Options:
  -h, --help         Show this help message

IDEA Inspect Options:
  -d                 Directory to be inspected. Whole project is inspected by default
  -profileName       Name of a profile defined in project
  -profilePath       Absolute path to the profile file
  -changes           Inspect uncommitted changes and report new problems
No project files found to inspect at '/data/project'!
```

Examples of execution tuneup:

- Override the default inspection profile:
   ```
   docker run ... -v <inspection-profile.xml>:/data/profile.xml <image-name>
   ```

- Save a report in HTML. By default, the HTML report will be stored in a separate `report/` subdirectory under the `results` directory. This location could be configured with `--report-dir`.
   ```
   docker run ... <image-name> --save-report
   ```

- Display a report in HTML. After the inspection is finished, the container will not exit and will listen to port `8080`. You can connect to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) to see the results. When done, you can stop the web server by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the Docker console.
   ```
   docker run ... -p 8080:8080 <image-name> --show-report
   ```

- Extra Gradle settings:
   ```
   docker run ... -v <source-directory>/gradle.properties:/root/.gradle/gradle.properties <image-name>
   ```

- Change the Heap size (default is 80% of host RAM):
   ```
   docker run ... -e _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx6g <image-name>
   ```

- Log INFO messages to STDOUT. By default, the log level for STDOUT is WARN.
   ```
   docker run ... -e IDE_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY='-Didea.log.config.file=info.xml' <image-name>
   ```

- Use own `idea.properties` file:
   ```
   docker run ... -e IDEA_PROPERTIES=/data/project/idea.properties <image-name>
   ```


### Order of resolving profile

Qodana checks the configuration parameters for resolving the inspection profile in this order:
1. Profile with the name `%name%` from the command line option `-profileName %name%`.
2. Profile by the path `%path%` from the command line option `-profilePath %path%`.
3. Profile with the name `%name%` from `qodana.yaml`.
4. Profile by the path `%path%` from `qodana.yaml`.
5. Profile mounted to `/data/profile.xml`.
6. Fall back to using the embedded `qodana.recommended` profile.

### Plugins management

The Qodana image contains all bundled Idea Ultimate plugins + bundled PhpStorm plugins. 

Paid plugins are yet unsupported, each vendor must clarify licensing terms for CI usage and collaborate with us to make it work

You can add any free IntellJ platform plugins or your custom plugin using the following command:

```
docker run ... -v /your/custom/path/%pluginName%:/opt/idea/plugins/%pluginName% <image-name>
```

To optimize the most common cases, some bundled plugins are disabled by default. You can check the whole list of disabled plugins in `/root/.config/idea/disabled_plugins.txt`.

By default are enabled: Java, Kotlin for Server Side, PHP, and their libraries/frameworks' plugins. Gradle and Maven plugins are also enabled.

To change the plugins list, do any of the following:
- Override `disabled_plugins.txt` by mounting your own file:
    ```
        docker run ... -v $empty_file$:/root/.config/idea/disabled_plugins.txt <image-name>
    ```
- Use IDE properties `idea.required.plugins.id` and `idea.suppressed.plugins.id`:
    ```
    docker run ... -e IDE_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY='-Didea.required.plugins.id=JavaScript,org.intellij.grails' <image-name> 
    ```
or
    ```
    docker run ... -e IDE_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY=' -Didea.suppressed.plugins.id=com.intellij.spring.security' <image-name> 
    ```

### Analyze changes

Qodana allows checking only changed files:
```
docker run  -e IDE_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY='-Didea.required.plugins.id=Git4Idea,Subversion,hg4idea' <image-name> -changes
```
You can adjust the `idea.required.plugins.id` value and keep only the CVS plugin suitable for your project.

### Run as non-root

By default, container runs as `root` user, so Qodana would be able to read any bind-mounted volumes with project and write the results. Which also leads to files in `results/` folder owned by `root` after the run.  
To avoid this you can run container as current user:
```
docker run -u $UID ...
# or
docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) ...
```
Please note that in this case `results/` folder on host should already be created and owned by you. Either docker would create it as `root` and Qodana would be unable to write to it.

### Turn off user statistics

To disable the [reporting of usage statistics](README.md#usage-statistics), adjust the `idea.headless.enable.statistics` value: 
```
docker run  -e IDE_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY="-Didea.headless.enable.statistics=false" <image-name> 
```
